- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dsyvanen1
I am a retired Grandpa that learned Fortran in the '70s, has taken C at a community college, read a "Learn
Hyper-text in 30 Minutes" book, but wants to learn more.

My Ubuntu 22.04 uefi crashed 27695 Build on my Canary slice, so I had to do a clean install of Beta Build.  
I run everything else in virtualbox: Debian Bookworm, Linux Mint 22 and Kali.

I'm between running MinGW compiler or Visual Studio depending on my study time which works to near zero while 
watching 6 grandkids, a Hell's Angels neighbor and two other "Let's hate Don" types of neighbors.
